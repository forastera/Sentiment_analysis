Had the 3 ice cream bars. Chocolate and beer, raspberry, and mango chili lime which was the best but definitely not worth coming back for. The choc and beer bar was bitter and tasted like the alcohol was not cooked off correctly. This was really not good. Coconut panna cotta was decent. Bellini sorbet tasted of alcohol fumes and peach. The ideas are creative and very interesting.

Everything looks fantastic and displayed attractively. But ended up leaving severely disappointed as we were really excited to try. I don't mind spending money for quality but this was not a good value unfortunately. It looks like the business owner cares but someone back there needs to taste what's going out for sale. $9 for tiny pastry is insane. You would expect it to taste amazing and exceptional for this price, but it's not even very good. Just ok. You can get much better for a half price. Will never go back.

Overpriced $14 wanna be desert. Strawberry rhubarb pate de fruits? Because people can't handle rhubarb by itself or is it to make the menu look fancy? Mignardise sized. Yes it is as bland as it looks. Tasteless mousse. pate de fruit tasted like cheap jam. bottom cookie was the usual boring. I would have liked it if i didnâ€™t have teeth.

If you're a real aficionado you'll realize it's all a bad joke. If you're going to charge premium, offer premium goods. 8 or 9$ is fair for the SF rent. 14$ is just ludicrous. Save your $$ and go to a Michelin star restaurant. The desserts will be cheaper.

This place holds dear to my heart and has become a tradition and lasting memory for my daughter. I love every thing about Sixth Course from the intelligent, elegant, and creative confections to the owners. This truly stands out as their dream and passion. I taste it in every bite.

Absolutely love this place. Got a chocolate cream pie dessert from here. It was to die for. Delish. Never been disappointed by any dessert at this place. Oooh and the popsicles- a must try.

Probably one of the best dessert shops I've been to. Great selection of hand crafted desserts from scratch that are truly works of art!

We were sent here as a recommendation for gluten free/ dairy free desserts. I was pleasantly surprised by the truffle and gelato selection. The chef went out of her way to make my little girl a dairy free drinking chocolate and helped up pick out great desserts for my family.

My friend and I stumbled into this place and we found our go to dessert spot! Not only are the desserts creative and beautifully put together but they are amazingly delicious!! We got to meet and talk with the owner who told us how the whole store got put together. It astounds me how much passion is put into her work and that each piece of dessert is well thought out and carefully designed. Definitely a place to check out!!

The overall average of 4.5 stars is well deserved. The presentation of these cakes are sure to wow everyone who sees them. These cakes are so delightful! The average is around $15 a piece so it might be steep for some people, but it's definitely worth it! The flavors are good and overall not too sweet, which is a problem I tend to have with most bakeries. The gelato popsicles are decadent and if the gelato shells are a representation of what the truffles are going to be like, then I'm definitely impressed and will need to make a third trip back just for the truffles pretty soon.
