So cute! So cozy! So chill! The crowd is relaxed and fun.  Feels kind of like an elevated summer camp or something like that. Love the open air and inside/outside situation and bet it will be great in the winter too! Stands out as something different in he neighborhood, and ringolevio next door is always a sure bet for a proper meal.
