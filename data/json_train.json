  {"text": "Such amazing chocolate! The first time I had Dandelion was at a sake tasting at Beshock in San Diego. I was blown away by the chocolate (and how well it went with sake!), so I was very excited when I got to visit the location in San Francisco.Upon arrival, I was at a loss for words. There was so much chocolate and so many delicious smells. I tried numerous chocolates, all wonderful. My favorite was one of the nutty ones. I went to order and as soon as I saw a s'more, I just ordered immediately and didn't look at anything else, which I probably should have. But after eating the s'more, nothing else in the world mattered because it was the most delicious thing I had every put in my mouth. I tasted the brownie flight and the chocolate blueberry corn bread muffin, but those were nothing compared to my s'more (I mean they were delicious too, but I was on cloud 9, aka their marshmallows) it was not as good. I stopped here again to grab a cup of Four Barrel on my way out of town. I love this place with most all of my being.","label": "pos"},
  {"text": "Wow. What an expensive yet disgusting piece of dark chocolate. How can you not have any vegan treats? And why be so rude about it when I asked?! The only thing they had was some unsweet chunk of something nasty I spit out for like 20 dollars. Why bother?!Update yo stuff y'all! Vegans are taking over the world. Step it up!! I'll come back when you do.","label":"neg"},
  {"text": "Super rude. We arrived here at 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and then waited in line for 15 minutes. When we got to the front of the line, and ordered our desserts we obviously wanted to eat there, the cashier told us we could only take them to go since they closed at 10. Really?! How long does it take to eat a dessert? And why not just tell everyone that before they waited in your line? We left without buying anything and will not be back.","label": "neg"},
  {"text": "Stale cookie, so so chocolates, not that good. Out of touch person working there accepted my cash (one penny short on change) then proceeded to say okay and handed me .99 cents. Embarrassing for them all around, I'll never go back.","label":"neg"},
  {"text": "ugh...these hipsters are tripping giving me the world's smallest hot chocolate, seriously like 6 ounces for $5.75.  I don't mind spending $$ on quality, but come on, I just felt stupid paying that much for like five sips.  It wasn't even that good, their selection was underwhelming.  I expected it to be at least decent, but it was so bad that I feel the need to spread the word to not go into this hipster money pit of garbage as it was surprisingly busy for the low quality, over-priced crap they were serving. Their horchata was like drinking clumpy cinnamon pudding(and not in a good way).","label": "neg"},
  {"text": "It was absolutely disgusting. The marshmallow was burnt, the chocolate was too salty, and they graham cracker was just ok, nothing spectacular. This was a complete waste of my time and money. I definitely won't be coming back, and I won't be recommending this place anytime soon.", "label":"neg"},
  {"text": "This place is exactly the kind of hipster garbage that the mission is so famous for. I got the ginger lemon iced chocolate and it tasted like bitter ass pudding with lemon juice. It also smells weird in here. Everything on the menu is overpriced. They have chocolate making classes which I thought might be cool but it turns out they're 50$. Avoid.","label": "neg"},
  {"text": "Anyway, the drinks here are marvelous.  Next time I'd probably go with their tea (loose leaf) if I wanted a dessert.  I decided to go whole hog though and get their frozen hot chocolate and a Paris Brest I think it was called (like a brioche or donut sandwich with cream in the middle).  Their drinks come with a very cute little chocolate cookie which was quite tasty. They also have classes and events, which I would like to try one day.","label": "pos"},
  {"text": "Amazing small batch chocolates!  I recommend the chefs sample plate. You get to enjoy all the wonders of this shop. The homemade marshmallows are a must have.", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "Cute place.  Smells divine.  The frozen chocolate drink was chocolatey and delicious.  The chef's tasting was like five tiny things with adorable tiny utensils and they were all pretty tasty.  I'd definitely come back.", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "I tasted a bunch of chocolate samples and it was super cool, so many cocoa beans from many different countries, all uniquely profiled for taste and flavors. It's definitely not cheap though, it's between $8-12 dollars for each bar of chocolate and I ended up getting two. The best, most amazing thing about their chocolate is that they create their bars in the actual store and it goes all the way back. You can also time your visit and do a tour as well. I got to hold a cocoa bean which was much larger than I thought and super exciting for a chocolate lover like myself. All of the chocolate bars are also made with cocoa beans and cane sugar only which is nice, no other additives, coloring, artificial flavors, etc. ", "label": "pos"},

  {"text": "They have displays on the counter that is super helpful when it comes to choosing what you want! The Chef's Tasting was amazing and all too adorable! They were miniature and bite sized with a little tiny fork and knife! Ahh! The chocolate is so rich, dense and perfectly sweetened. You can honestly taste the quality! The bubbly milk shake was like a dark chocolate champagne and so fun to drink! I loved the bubblies! The mini striped straw was sooo cute! Their mini s'more was so fresh with the perfect squish of marshmallow with the chocolate graham bottom. I don't want to describe everything so you can go and have a taste test yourself! I think you'll like it :)!", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "I've had many and this place is the best, chewy yet crunchy on the sides. Most importantly the chocolate is in gigantic square chunks throughout each bite! If you're a chocolate fanatic, this is the place to go! Always on the look out for the best cookie!! ", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "We were mainly there for the european drinking hot chocolate ($4.50). It came in a perfectly designed sipping cup/stand with a cookie treat. Very well thought out design. It wasnt a huge serving of hot chocolate but its because you dont need much of it. It's very rich and flavorful. Dandelion boasts that they only use 2 ingredients in their chocolate. That's cocoa beans and cane sugar. Chocolate purists indeed. We sampled their house made smores and it was very good. Different from your traditional but it was good. Homemade graham cracker on the bottom, chocolate layer and a marshmallow topping layered over that. It was good. It's quite sweet but it was good", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "Here it taste really yummy. Served in a pot, they give you cups for it.  Then we ordered the brownie bite flight which was yummy, 4 stars.  I will be back for sure to try out new items!", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "I got the frozen hot chocolate and my aunt got the mission hot chocolate. Both were delicious depending on if you want hot or cold. He frozen hot chocolate was sweet but not too sweet. They also had really good homemade marshmallows. I will definitely be going back and getting the chefs table.", "label": "pos"},

  {"text": "This was my first visit to Castro and Mission neighborhood and this Dandelion place is amazing!! Everything looked very tasty and inviting. I tried the Chef's tasting menu and it was delicious. The red velvet and panda cotta was delicious.. panda cotta was my favorite! There is always a line irrespective of the time you reach Dandelion.. be it noon evening or late night (Yes we went that many times)!! The place is elegantly decorated and you can try different chocolates from different parts of the world. They even have a small exhibit inside to show the process of chocolate making. Definitely a must visit if you are a chocolate addict :)", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "Just amazing!! Was my first visit to the Mission and Castro part of the city and was blown away by the sheer food options around. This place was amazing, and with a huge huge line to boot. I basically walked away the first time as the line was out of the door. Went back at 930pm, still had a line, but just 3 people in front of me. Since it was late I got the frozen hot chocolate which was out of this world! I'll be back to try the chocolate tasting flight!!", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "Pure heavenly delight! Dandelion is like no other. Don't miss this if you have any interest in chocolate and you're in SF. It's really special.", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "Wow! I walked by recently and decided to follow my nose, leading me into this den of chocolate decadence. They make their own chocolate from 2 ingredients: single origin cacao beans from different countries and sugar. When you enter the space, you are immediately drawn to the samples of chocolate bars that differ by provenance. They also make sweets including s'mores and cookies, hot chocolate and mocha drinks. Everything I tried was pure delight. I would highly recommended Dandelion to any chocolate lover and anyone taking a degustation tour of the Mission!", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": " I also had the giant s'mores. Oh my god. Love the way how the workers torched the s'mores to make the chocolate in the center of the marshmellow melty and the marshmellow toasty. I went to s'more heaven :) I love this place because the chocolate is so authentic and made from different kinds of regions. What a chocolaticious experience. I will probably need to get european hot chocolate next time. If you have a sweet tooth for sweets and you need a nice treat from the cold chilly night, this is a wonderful place to go :)", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "If you like chocolate, I highly recommend this cool joint. The mocha is excellent and so is their hot chocolate. It comes with a cute tiny cookie which complements the drink perfectly. Free marshmallow at the counter if you are craving for more sweetness.", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "The crazy chocolate lovers among us love to drink chocolate. This way the ingredients get directly into our veins. And, we are not talking about milk/water mixed chocolate, but make it as pure as possible.Order the European Drinking Chocolate. If you are not there yet, it is OK. Just order other great items from the menu.", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "We ordered the European drinking chocolate and the spicy hot chocolate upon recommendation from the girl who rang us up. We also ordered a s'mores! It was the prettiest s'mores I've ever seen and tasted so good, not too sweet at all and the chocolate was high quality. The hot chocolates came in cute little drinking cups and mine came with a little spoon to stir. The European drinking chocolate was amazing! Super chocolatey and thick, kinda gets to be too much though as it cools down. ", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "A really great cute cafe and really friendly staff! Few things I would recommend doing when you get there: 1) Try out all the free chocolate samples 2) Chat with the staff and learn more about how a coffee bean turns into a chocolate bar 3) Get a factory tour (make a reservation online) and 4) buy some goodies (would highly recommend dulce de leche bar).", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "The interior is warm and welcoming and the scent of chocolate is quite enticing. I have had this place bookmarked forever and was so excited to finally get here! The chocolate bars are pricey but they are single origin and like fine wine, there are flavor notes offered by each bar depending where the beans are sourced. Samples are offered. The glass case of sweets all looked so good but it was still early so I opted for a cup of hot chocolate. They offer almond milk and soymilk for non dairy folks like myself. I ordered the house hot chocolate which came with a mini cocoa shortbread cookie. They also offer nuggets of raw sugar  (for coffee) and housemade marshmallows to top my chocolate. Goodness they are like pillows from heaven! The hot chocolate itself was one of the best I've ever had. The texture was like velvet, not overly sweet, and nicely frothy on top. I will remember this hot chocolate for the rest of my life! Service was on point", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "THE ABSOLUTE BEST HOT CHOCOLATE. While the price of their house hot chocolate or anything on their menu was not cheap, I decided to trust the reviews and go with it. Within 2 minutes my hot chocolate was ready, in a smaller cup than expected but let me tell you that size really does NOT matter. The hot chocolate was sweet and creamy, everything I could imagine of an ideal hot chocolate. If I'm ever around I will definitely go back and probably order two drinks of deliciousness!", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "Love love love this place !!! Satisfies all my dessert cravings - the scent of delicious chocolate hits you as soon as you walk into the door. Every single thing is delicious ! Their desserts, their drinks, their chocolates. It's fast becoming my favorite dessert place.", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "Come and try their European drinking hot chocolate!! It's the best I've had! Perfect consistency and not too sweet. We came here on a. Old rainy day which made it even better! The place is cute but with limited seating but you should definitely give this place a try if you're in the area.i also saw some people with the cold chocolate dessert which also looks amazing and that's probably what I'll try next if I go on a warmer day!", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "The European Drinking Chocolate & House Hot Chocolate are my favorite of the bunch. Both are very good. I'd highly recommend Dandelion Chocolate if you are a chocolate lover. They also provide house-made marshmallows near the side table & samples of chocolate pieces near the register for free.", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "This place was incredible! It's a chocolate shop with everything you'd ever want to be inside a chocolate shop. There's seats so you can enjoy with friends. You can get a plain chocolate bar or some hot cocoa. And, the hot cocoa comes in an adorable little cup with freshly made marshmallows. There's also a selection of desserts to choose from. The whole place has a decor that makes you think you're in a chocolate factory and it even smells of chocolate here. Come here to chat with a friend or to get a wonderful snack for yourself but if you're in the area, this is a unique and wonderful find that shouldn't be missed.", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "I've had the the four barrel mission mocha which was one of the best mochas I've ever had. It's only slightly sweet and a tad spicy.

Some expensive chocolates but worth it. My second favorite chocolates are the white chocolates. Every holiday, Schurra's has seasonal fresh chocolates just perfect for the holiday. Recently, I purchases peanut butter eggs, white chocolate carrot, chocolate covered pretzels for my kids' Easter basket. If you are local and never been, you have to stop by and check out.

The Maya chocolate was the only decent thing. The Peppermint Chew was not chewy at all, but rock hard like a Starlight mint. I should have known it would be bad when I asked for it and the guy waiting on me paused and said That's one of our older recipes. I think he meant older candies! It was either so old it got hard, or it is a misnomer, because there was nothing chewable about that at all. I spit it out in the garbage. The marshmallow heart was equally disappointing with a flavorless marshmallow and a hard, waxy chocolate exterior. Into the garbage it went as well. Hubby said his truffles weren't a good texture either. The chocolate is not creamy. On a positive note, the place smells good when you walk in and it's pretty cute inside. I love that they've been in business forever, but sort of mystified as to why", "label": "neg"},

There are plenty of unique and elegant truffles to choose from, there's gelatto for a fun treat, the store has a great location near the movie theater, and the people working are always sweet and helpful. I am so happy that Chocolate Visions has a home in Scotts Valley!", "label": "pos"},

Be sure to call or text before dropping by, as their location is a rental kitchen (they are not always there). We were lucky enough to drop by right before a big show. We were able to try a ton of different delicious  chocolates and bought the biggest box they sell. The price is amazing for the top notch quality. Highly recommend!", "label": "pos"},

  {"text": "Got a selection of truffles and a turtle.  Worst chocolate I've ever had, and WAAAAY too expensive, even it if it was good chocolate. For instance, an Irish Cream Truffle had almost no Irish Cream flavor.  The turtle tasted like nothing. Too bad they feel they can rip off tourists because of the location.

  {"text": "These chocolates are absolutely amazing. The hard outer shell and the melt in your mouth inside... make these chocolates out of this word. I purchased a variety box of 9 because I wanted to try the different filling flavors... each was better than the last. The texture is incredible, and these chocolates are just the RIGHT richness. Sometimes you find yourself needing a glass of water after eating some more intense chocolate, but the ingredients are so high quality, Phillippe really makes the perfect truffle", "label": "pos"},
  {"text": "In German, there is a saying: \"Don't carry owls to Athens,\" where the owl symbolizes wisdom and the pursuit of academics, and Athens in the olden days was the center of just that.

  {"text": "I was dissatisfied on the way the crew prepared my hot chocolate. It was bland. Period. The mediocre hot chocolate could have been compensated by a good service. The staff did not know the difference between a Lactaid and latte. Unfortunately, the staff are more interested in checking their iPhones than doing things the right way. Now, I missed Max Brenner!", "label": "neg"},
  {"text": "The chocolate here is pretty average. We came here and got an assortment of their truffles, a cappuccino, and a hot chocolate. The truffles tasted similar to what I would get at Godiva -- really sweet with plain tasting chocolate (no special notes). The hot chocolate was almost undrinkable -- too much milk and way too much sugar. The cappuccino was ok, but I also thought it had a bit too much milk in it. Service was good -- the staff were really friendly.", "label": "neg"},

My first disappointment was how long it took someone to come down from the office/ kitchen to help me. There were three people working, all to busy to stop and come down, or at least acknowledge I was in the store. Then I was more disappointed when I said I wanted to purchase $10-$15 dollars worth of individual pieces of chocolate, I then asked if they could be put. In a box, I was told they only have bags for individual candy.  Just so you understand, they package everything in the store, they have various sizes of boxes. Yet, I could not have one.

  {"text": "I am severely disappointed at how the chocolate quality has decreased in this shop. I actually used to really enjoyed this place with it being new, and having high end chocolate. But after going several times I started to notice that the pricing wasn't worth the small bites any longer. The fillings are now being cheaply filled and made (not much inside to bite into, and that used to be the best part), the quality of chocolate has decreased because it taste old (like it has spent a few nights in the fridge), and the customer service has gone from nice to passive aggressive.
